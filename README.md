# peruse ðŸ‘€

Scroll through webpages automatically. This is useful for browsing through operations dashboards.

### Usage

```
peruse --links <path> [--rate <px> | --fast | --medium | --slow] [--executable <executable>]
```

Create a file containing all links you wish to load. If this file is executable, stdout is intercepted upon running this file.

```
https://www.lipsum.com/
https://www.gutenberg.org/
```
then run
```sh
peruse --links links.txt
```

to open a Puppeteer window that scrolls through site alternatively.

#### Shortcuts

Peruse binds the following shortcuts to each target page:

- <kbd>1</kbd>: set speed to slow
- <kbd>2</kbd>: set speed to medium
- <kbd>3</kbd>: set speed to fast
- <kbd>`Space`</kbd>: pause / unpause

### Tests

Tests that:

- scrolling stops / starts in the correct locations
- the page title dynamically updates
- pause and unpause works
- each speed scrolls at the expected rate
